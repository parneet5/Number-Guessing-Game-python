# Number-Guessing-Game-python

This Python project is an interactive number guessing game, where the program randomly selects a 
number between 1 and 100, and the player attempts to guess it within a limited number of attempts. 
The game provides feedback such as “Too high” or “Too low” after each guess to guide the player
toward the correct answer.

The program includes two difficulty levels—easy (10 attempts) and hard (5 attempts)—allowing players 
to choose the level of challenge they prefer. It uses functions to manage difficulty settings, 
validate guesses, and track remaining attempts, making the code modular and easy to follow.

This project highlights core programming concepts such as conditionals, loops, functions, and 
randomization. It also demonstrates how to design an engaging, replayable game with simple logic 
and user interaction.

Beyond its learning value, this project reflects real-world applications of game design and user 
feedback loops, where randomized outcomes and structured rules combine to create an interactive 
experience.
